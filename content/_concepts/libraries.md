CSS and JS

Toolkits -> packages of handy stuff, Font Awesome?

Libraries -> tools to complete some specific task.

Frameworks -> skeleton + tools to organize and create an application.

What about something like SASS?

Examples:

- CSS and front-end components: Bootstrap, Foundation, Bulma, Tailwind CSS
- JS utilities: jQuery, DataTables
- JS frameworks: React, Angular, Vue
