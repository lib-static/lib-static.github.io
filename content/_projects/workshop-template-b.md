`workshop-template-b` is a minimal Jekyll template for creating workshop websites designed for simple hosting on GitHub Pages.
The template provides a Bootstrap 5 theme with builtin customization options.
Content is written in Markdown and can be enhanced using Bootstrap features in Liquid includes.

## Why

The concept is to replace the slides many people make for workshops with an easy to create website. 
Writing a few markdown files is usually easier than creating a slide deck and is easier to access, reuse, and adapt.
Since the source code is available and easy to copy on GitHub, it makes a great OER. 

## How

To use, make a copy of the template, fill in your information in the "_config.yml", and write your content in Markdown files. 
GitHub Pages automated Jekyll build will transform it into a website with navigation exposed at the top and bottom of each page for easy stepping through the sections. 
Bootstrap components can be added using pre-configured Includes. 

Since the template is designed to be simple, you can use it entirely in the GitHub web interface--you don't need to install anything on your computer. 
For more advanced use, you would need the typical Jekyll stack (Git, Ruby, Jekyll).

## Examples

The `workshop-template-b` was set up by University of Idaho librarian Evan Williamson for his own teaching, but has been adopted by others at U of I and beyond.
