Build with Hugo and the Geekdocs theme, this OER provides lesson plan, bibliography, and learning resources to understand static web approaches for academic librarians.

From the home page:

"Websites for scholarly publications and digital scholarship are expected to be stable for long-term access, citation, and archiving. Static websites provide a durable and low-cost solution for making and distributing scholarly works.

In library and academic contexts, static websites have been used for conference websites, digitization projects, archival metadata, academic journals, edited monographs, and open textbooks.

These resources introduce this powerful technology for scholarly communications librarianship."
