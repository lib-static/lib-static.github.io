The Historical Topographic Map Digitization Project was a large collaborative project to provide open access to a collection of digitized historic maps of Ontario. 
The website was built using Hugo static generator.
It used ImageMagick to generate map image derivatives and gdal2tiles to generate tile web map files for static access (see [processing scripts](https://github.com/jasonbrodeur/OCUL_HTDP)).
