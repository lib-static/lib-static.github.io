A unique approach to providing search for a static site using XSLT to process the HTML documents and generate a collection of JSON indexes. 
A JavaScript search function can then query the JSON to efficiently return results, including boolean and phrasal searches, various types of search filter, keyword-in-context results, and bookmarkable search results. 
The tool is developed by [The Endings Project](https://endings.uvic.ca/index.html).

Examples in use:

- [Mapping Keats's Progress](https://johnkeats.uvic.ca/search.html)
- [The Map of Early Modern London](https://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/search.htm)
- [The Winnifred Eaton Archive](https://www.winnifredeatonarchive.org/search.html)
- [The Colonial Despatches](https://bcgenesis.uvic.ca/search.html)
