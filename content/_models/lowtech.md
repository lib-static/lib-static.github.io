Description from the [about page](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about/what-is-low-tech-magazine/): "Low-tech Magazine underscores the potential of past and often forgotten technologies and how they can inform sustainable energy practices."

Low-tech Magazine's website was redesigned in 2018 to run on a self-hosted, solar-powered server. 
Using the very limited energy supply required thoughtful design of the site assets, including a static web approach (first using [Pelican static site generator](https://getpelican.com/), now migrating to Hugo).
Depending on weather and usage, the solar site can go offline if it runs out of power, highlighting the often overlooked energy consumption of websites.
See [About the Solar Powered Website](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about/the-solar-website/) for more details and ideas.
