Using a light-weight agile sprint framework, participants in this symposium met over the course of a week in August 2021 to discuss the Lib-Static concept and envision ways and websites through which we can provide resources and assistance for our DH and library colleagues who would like to use static web/minimal computing techniques to develop web projects and templates. 

Much of the content for the initial seed of the Lib-Static site was created and curated during this meeting.

## Objectives

- Establish supportive and sustainable structures for the nascent Lib-Static community
- Discuss and develop a draft of the Lib-Static website
- Learn from each other's experiences and outlooks on creating, coding, and teaching with static web tools/techniques to develop library and digital scholarship web projects and templates.

## Participants

Marii Nyrop (NYU), Alex Gil (Columbia), Chris Diaz (Northwestern), Evan Williamson (University of Idaho), Devin Becker (University of Idaho), and Olivia Wikle (University of Idaho)
